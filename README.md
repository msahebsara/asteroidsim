# AstroidSim 
This program has been designed to simulate astroids in orbit and to showcase the best path for a spaceship to take to navigate such an asteroid belt.
Built for the 2017 Engineering Compeition @ UofA, Division: Programming. 

## Requirements 
Per the instructions of the competition, we were given 6 hours to do the following:
- You must visualize and simulate a variable size asteroid field
- When asteroids collide, they must break apart into smaller asteroids, whilst maintaining their original momentum
- There must be a method for changing the number of asteroids in the simulation
- The shuttle must be able to fly anywhere in the asteroid field and avoid the asteroids for as long as possible

## Usage
This program may be unzipped and placed on the server, or run directly from a local machine by opening the 
"index.html" file. 

## Acknowledgements   
We would like to thank the University of Alberta and Engineering Students Society for organizing this competition.
